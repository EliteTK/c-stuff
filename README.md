c-stuff
=======
This is simply a git repository of a directory in which I store all my
small c tests and other things. Don't expect amazing things, however,
some things in here (like the brainfuck to c parser) are projects that
don't get their own repository because of their size.

Licensing
=========
Only files with a license header are licensed under the GPLv3! The rest are unlicensed for reasons generally specified at the top of the file.
